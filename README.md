# Technical-Communication
"This course covers basic elements of technical communication, including professional written communication proficiency; the ability to strategize approaches for different audiences; and technical style, grammar, and syntax proficiency."
Your company is considering the implementation of a technology solution to address a business problem. As a member of the IT team for a manufacturing company, you were asked to select a product to address the identified needs, informing the stakeholders about its fit to the identified needs, and providing implementation details. Several past process changes have been unsuccessful at implementation and user acceptance. You will create two artifacts that communicate product information tailored to meet the needs of each of the following stakeholder groups:

•  Audience 1: executive leadership of the organization, such as the CIO, CFO, etc.
•  Audience 2: cross-functional team, including members from IT who will be implementing the product
